THe purpose of this final module is to employ machine learning (ML). There are three general categories of Machine Learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. This module will employ a type of supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model using all available data and use the resulting model (a "best-fit" straight line) to make predictions.

This module will include building a model, making predictions, visualizing the model, and publishing insights.
